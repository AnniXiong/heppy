             merged - the dictionary of merged clusters

        clusters a dictionary : {id1:ecal1, id2:ecal2, ...}
        ruler is something that measures distance between two objects eg track and hcal
            (see Distance class for example)
            it should take the two objects as arguments and return a tuple
            of the form
                link_type = 'ecal_ecal', 'ecal_track' etc
                is_link = true/false
                distance = float
        hist_nodes is an optional dictionary of Nodes : { id:Node1, id: Node2 etc}
            it could for example contain the simulation history nodes
            A Node contains the id of an item (cluster, track, particle etc)
            and says what it is linked to (its parents and children)
            if hist_nodes is provided it will be added to with the new block information
            If hist_nodes is not provided one will be created, it will contain nodes
            corresponding to each of the tracks, ecal etc and also for the blocks that
            are created by the event block builder.
