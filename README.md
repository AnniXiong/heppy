Heppy : a python framework for high-energy physics data analysis
================================================================

Heppy (High Energy Physics with PYthon) is a modular python framework for the analysis of collision events. 

If you're not very familiar with python yet, you will probably find the [Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/2.7/tutorial/) useful before you get started with heppy.
